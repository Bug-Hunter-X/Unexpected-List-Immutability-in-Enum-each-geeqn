This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Elixir when working with lists and immutability.  The code attempts to remove the element '3' from the list while iterating using `Enum.each`. However, due to Elixir's immutable nature,  `List.delete` creates a *new* list, and the original `list` remains unaffected. The solution illustrates the correct approach to modify a list, which involves using recursion or other functions designed for list manipulation.
